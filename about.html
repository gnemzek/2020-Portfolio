                <h2>Passionate Web Developer </h2>
                <p>I am always excited to create clear, clear code with peak accessibility. I love learning about the latest technologies available to developers and incorporating them into my work when applicable. </p>

                <h2>UX Focused Professional </h2>
                <p>User Experience is my top priority when I'm developing and designing. At the beginning of my development career, I read <a href="http://sensible.com/dmmt.html" class="inlineLink" target="_blank"> Don't Make Me Think </a> which has shaped
                    how I approach projects. An app or website is nothing without it’s users. I know how to put their experience first.

                <h2>Well-Rounded Tech Expert </h2>
                <p>I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from Concordia College in 2014, majoring in Sociology and Psychology. I have applied my education in a variety of industries, and have proven myself to be a fast learner who adapts well to new environments.

                <h2>When I Log Off </h2>
                <p>Once I’m offline, I’m an activist and cat dad living in Minneapolis, MN. I love to code (yes, even in my free time!), participating in community activism, playing video games, and petting cats. Before the world shut down, you could find
                    me at a local drag show or drinking decaf at a nearby coffee shop. Now, I spend my free time watering my flowers in Animal Crossing, enjoying a walk in the park, or hiding at home with a good book.
