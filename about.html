                        me at local drag shows, watering my flowers in Animal Crossing, or hiding at home with a good book. I love to keep up-to-date with the latest tech and best practices, and my favorite projects combine my skills in organization and
                        coding (like documentation libraries or intricate web apps).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I have 5+ years of experience in front-end web development, and I have 2+ years experience in UX development. </p>

                <h2>Web Developer with Passion </h2>
                <p>I bring passion to everything I do, both in and out of the workplace. When it comes to web development, I’m passionate about clean and clear code, accessibility, organization, and the latest technologies available for developers to use.
                    Outside of work, I’m passionate about equality and justice, making healthy choices, building community, and making connections. </p>

                <h2>UX Focused </h2>
                <p>An app or a website is nothing without users. User Experience has always been important to me, and it's the number one thing I like to focus on when I'm developing and designing. When I first started developing in undergrad, the first
                    book I read was <a href="http://sensible.com/dmmt.html" class="inlineLink" target="_blank"> Don't Make Me Think </a>, and it has shaped how I approach projects ever since.
