                <h3> Contextual Solutions</h3>
                <p>Let’s say you’re unsure of whether you need to overhaul and redesign your mobile experience. The answer lies with your users! If analytics show they don’t use your app on their phones, your time and money is better spent elsewhere. Where
                    exactly? Let your users guide that! Contextual solutions ensure that applications and web experiences are designed and developed around how users already use them, ensuring smooth rollouts and increased accessibility. </p>

                <h3> User-Driven Apps</h3>
                <p>UX is all about putting the user first, which means taking the time to get to know them. Each site and app has a different user they currently appeal to or are trying to attract, so it’s key for your web team to understand who you’re reaching
                    out to. Once we know your users, and how they presently engage with your website or application, we’re able to let them drive the development to maximize their usage and increase likelihood for retention. </p>
